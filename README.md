# The **GBClust** package for generalized Bayes clustering 

The repository includes the `R` functions to implement the clustering procedures of the paper:

* Rigon, T., Herring, A. H. and Dunson, D. B. (2020). [A generalized Bayes framework for probabilistic clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05451).

The `GBClust` package can be installed by running the following commands:

```R
# If the devtools R package is not already installed
# install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("tommasorigon/GBClust")
```

The [full documentation](https://github.com/tommasorigon/GBClust/raw/master/GBClust_0.0.2.pdf) of the `GBClust` package is available in this repository. Moreover, the file [`introduction.md`](tutorial/introduction.md) contains detailed instruction for reproducing **Figure 1** of the paper.

The files for reproducing the code of the paper are described in the [R_scripts_paper](https://github.com/tommasorigon/GBClust/tree/master/R_scripts_paper) folder.
