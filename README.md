# The **GBClust** package for generalized Bayes clustering 

The repository includes the `R` functions to implement the clustering procedures of the paper:

* Rigon, T., Herring, A. H. and Dunson, D. B. (2020+). [A generalized Bayes framework for probabilistic clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05451).

The `GBClust` package can be installed by running the following commands:

```R
# If the devtools R package is not already installed
# install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("tommasorigon/GBClust")
```
